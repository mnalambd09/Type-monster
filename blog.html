                    <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).

                           <strong>setItem() Method  –</strong> This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                           <strong>clear() Method –</strong>  This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage.

                    <h1 style="font-style:italic; color:tomato">Session Storage</h1>
                    <strong>Session Storage:</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.

                  <strong>Local Scop</strong> is defined as a type of variable declared within programming block or subroutines. It can only be used inside the subroutine or code block in which it is declared. The local variable exists until the block of the function is under execution. After that, it will be destroyed automatically.
                  <ol>
                    <h3>Local Scop:</h3>
                    <li>It is declared inside a function.</li>
                    <li>If it is not initialized, a garbage value is stored</li>
                    <li>It is created when the function starts execution and lost when the functions terminate.</li>
                    <li>Data sharing is not possible as data of the local variable can be accessed by only one function.</li>
                    <li>Parameters passing is required for local variables to access the value in other function.</li>
                    <li>It is stored on the stack unless specified.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <hr><hr>
                  <h1 style="font-style:italic; color:tomato">Global Scop</h1>
                  <strong>Global Scop</strong> in the program is a variable defined outside the subroutine or function. It has a global scope means it holds its value throughout the lifetime of the program. Hence, it can be accessed throughout the program by any function defined within the program, unless it is shadowed.
                  <ol>
                    <h3>Global Scop:</h3>
                    <li>It is declared outside the function.</li>
                    <li>If it is not initialized zero is stored as default.</li>
                    <li>It is created before the program’s global execution starts and lost when the program terminates.</li>
                    <li>Data sharing is possible as multiple functions can access the same global variable.</li>
                    <li>Parameters passing is not necessary for a global variable as it is visible throughout the program</li>
                    <li>It is stored on a fixed location decided by the compiler.</li>

                  <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
